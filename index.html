			<p>Gray wolves range in color from grizzled gray or black to all-white. As the ancestor of the domestic dog, the gray wolf
				resembles German shepherds. Though they once nearly disappeared from the lower 48 states, today wolves have
				returned to the Great Lakes, northern Rockies and South western United States.</p>
